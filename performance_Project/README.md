## Christopher Wright's improvements

### First run the website

Go to these sites git hub hosted site which shows the final draft of my project:
[Pizza site improved](https://cswright88.github.io/cswright88.github.io/performance_Project/views/pizza.html)
[the index page](https://cswright88.github.io/cswright88.github.io/performance_Project/) running with a 90% PageSpeeds insights score 

### Improvements for the Index page

I optimize the large image from the Pizza site by adding a smaller version of that photo for the index site.  I also removed the external style sheet and added the style rules in the index file.  I also added print media tag to the print.css to prevent it from loading.  With async added to the stylesheets to allow js files to load after 

### Improvements on the pizza site

Computational Efficiency: the time to resize the Pizzas when you click the slider is less than 5 ms now.  This was done probably a little bit differently than most but I basically added an array to push all the layout elements into an array to be used by the next for loop where I changed the style elements and used the layout elements from the array to prevent FSL.  
Frame Rate: hits at an average of 60 FPS by adding var scrolltop = document.body.scrollTop; outide of the for loop in the updatePositions function preventing FSL.  


## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository and inspect the code.


### Getting started

#### Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to the top-level of your project directory to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ./ngrok http 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

#### Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
