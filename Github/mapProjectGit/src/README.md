### How To Load
	1. For the best expierence, use a local host like XAMPP or Python's SimpleHTTPServer.  You can also view this on a web page if you add it your git hub pages or a personal website
	2. load the dist folders index.html file for the best performance

### What I used
	1. Wikipedia API 
	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page
	2. Google Maps API 
	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/
	3. Google Street View
	https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/
	4. Knockout 
	http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/introduction.html

### Known Issues
	1. The links inside the wikipedia articles do not actually load to the location that the article intended
	2. The photos will not load unless you are using a local host or viewing this on a hosted website.  See 'How To Load' section to view how to view a version of this website that shows the wikipedia pictures
