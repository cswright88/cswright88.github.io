#My Arcade game readme file

##how to run

1. open the **index.html** file with your browser 
_We highly recommend that you use **chrome** because it is better_

##how to play

1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player **up**, **right**, **left**, and **down**.
2. The goal of the game is to move your player into the water without getting hit by the bugs moving across the screen.  
3. Each time you get to the water you score one point and you are sent back to the starting point
4. If you are hit by bug, you lose a life and you are sent back to the starting point. 
5. You have only 4 lives so be careful.  
6.  If you lose all 4 of your lives the game is over.  
7.  **Goodluck and have fun**

##issues
1.  moving the character seems to also move the browser window depending on your browser settings.  

##license
This is a project I did with udacity using their images and set up to create the game.  I added to the app.js file to create and make the game functional.  Use this file and game as much as you want.  Feel free to contribute.
